The binary search tree in commonly used to implement other structures like BTS, and AVL trees
- each node contains a value or data element
- each node has at most 2 children
	- left and right
- BST
	- the value of a node's left child is always less than the value of the node itself, and the value of a node's right child is always greater than that of the node
- height of the tree is log(N) for N = the number of nodes
