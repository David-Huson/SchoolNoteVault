- Need to review **a-priori** and **a-posteriori**
- Practice induction proofs
- Algorithm analysis, need to run through some O(log) examples to get familiar with those
- complexity of common algorithms (Representative Algorithms of Certain Complexity)
- review Asymptotic Notation
	- Big-O: upper bound
	- Big Omega: lower bound
	- Big Theta: exact bound
	- Little-O: upper bound, not asymptotically tight
	- Little-O: lower bound, not asymptotically tight
- Amortized analysis: aggregate analysis and potential method
- Know the differences between different height balanced trees
- Remember that all the hight balanced trees are BST's
- know the purpose of the B-tree
