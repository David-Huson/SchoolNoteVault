- A General approach or methodology for solving problems using algorithms
- one of the most important aspects of algorithm design ins choice o fan appropriate algorithmic paradigm
- Different algorithm paradigms are suited to different types of problems

## Common Paradigms
[[Brute Force]]
-  trying all possible solutions
[[Heuristic Algorithm]]
- a problem-solving technique which uses shortcuts in a given limited time frame to produce an almost perfect solution
- [[Genetic Algorithm]]
[[Backtracking]]
- a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational probs
- backtrack to the previous decision point if a partial solution cannot lead to a solution
[[Divide and conquer]]
- break down a big problem into sub problems
- sub problems are independent
	- E.g Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
[[Dynamic programming]]
-  Like divide and conquer but where the sub problems are not independent
[[Graph Algorithm]]
- a category of algorithms designed to solve problems related to graphs, which are mathematical structures consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect these nodes.
[[Greedy Algorithm]]
- makes the locally optimal choice at each step in the hopes of finding a global optimum
