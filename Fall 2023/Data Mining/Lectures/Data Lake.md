- A single repository of all enterprise data in raw or transformed formats
- an alternative to data warehouses
- a way for someone to perform ad-hoc analysis quickly on raw or transformed data from disparate sources, without the need to request the data within the organization
- Data is written/pushed into the lake from the various source systems, instead of having to be read/pulled from the various source systems
- data lakes must be secured, with access granted on a need-to-know basis
